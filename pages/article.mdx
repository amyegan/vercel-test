[Steve Hayes' TED talk on psychological flexibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o79_gmO5ppg) is something I think about a lot. It is relevant to individual mental health, but also to approaching other people with compassion. Acceptance of what _is_ and identifying _why_ we feel the way we do can help us act with meaning and purpose. It can help us approach frustrating situations and difficult people with empathy and patience.
