# Question 4

> Imagine a customer reaches out in our GitHub community asking "How do I do a redirect from [/hello-vercel](/hello-vercel) to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)?" In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?

I would recommend visiting this [Redirect Article](https://vercel.com/support/articles/does-vercel-support-permanent-redirects?query=redire) if they have not already. If they needed further help, I would walk them through some troubleshooting steps, like ensuring there are no formatting errors or typos. And I might have them try a different method to see if that worked better.

If I couldn't successfully help them get it working myself, I would need to reach out to someone on the engineering team (or at least someone with more Next.js redirect knowledge than I currently have).
