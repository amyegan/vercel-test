# Question 7

> A customer writes in to our GitHub community stating "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project". In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?

This is certainly an efficient answer! I think that directing the user to a useful doc is a good move, but the message could perhaps have been phrased in a more friendly way. I also think it would have been more helpful to link to the specific section of the doc that would be most helpful for their use case. Maybe something like:

> Hi @lsei, You can use [Ignore Build Step](https://vercel.com/support/articles/how-do-i-use-the-ignored-build-step-field-on-vercel#with-folders-and-workspaces) to set `common` as your "root directory" for triggering builds.

I think [this response](https://github.com/vercel/community/discussions/470#discussioncomment-2379442) to a similar question I found in the GitHub community is really nice.
