# Question 9

> If you could make one change to our flagship community, what would it be and why?

I'll admit I don't know enough about the existing Vercel community to make a well-informed recommendation. From what I have seen, I can say that the community feels a little quiet. I would love to get it a bit more traffic and love.

I suspect that it will get more lively once it becomes the source of support for Hobby Tier. I also think we could also use social media, the docs site, and other channels to direct people to use the community as more of a resource on all tiers.
