# Question 5

> A customer writes in to our GitHub community stating "I have a custom domain which I purchased at GoDaddy and I want to use it on my project". In a couple of paragraphs, how do you respond?

I would direct them to the [Custom Domains](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/custom-domains) doc which should have all the information they need to connect a custom domain.

If they had already tried that without success, I would gather some more details to figure out what was going wrong for them. And I would reach out to someone with more knowledge on this topic than I currently have if needed.
