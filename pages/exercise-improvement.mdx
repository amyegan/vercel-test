# Question 10

> How could we improve or alter this familiarisation exercise?

I would recommend against using the [Documentation Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Markdown%20powered%20docs%20site.%20Built%20with%20Next.js.&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2Fdemo.png&demo-title=Documentation%20Starter%20Kit&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2F&project-name=nextjs-docs&repository-name=nextjs-docs&s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra&from=templates) template for this since it slowed me down a bit. ðŸ˜… The template itself is really cool, but some quirks with special characters and sibling directories took a little extra work to solve or work around.

Overall, I think it was a pretty cool project.
