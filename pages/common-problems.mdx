# Question 8

> What do you think is one of the most common problems which customers ask Vercel for help with? How would you help customers to overcome common problems, short-term and long-term?

Without digging much into community questions first, I would guess that common problems include configuration mistakes and difficult knowing what search terms to use to find the right docs. Tech has a ton of jargon and it can be really difficult for newbies to get started with a new technology before they know the lingo.

In the short-term, I would provide guidance with doc links and try to include more generic wording to make it more searchable for people who have the same problem in the furture. In the long term, I would push for updates to official documentation to help make sure users have everything they need in one place rather than having them frequently search for answers.
